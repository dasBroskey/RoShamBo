# RoShamBo
# Overview

To enhance my c++ skills, I created a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The game utilizes a while loop to allow continous play. The player and computer wins are tracked and displayed.

I began with a tutorial for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game and added the scoring feature as well as a loop for continous play.

# Development Environment

To create this program I used Visual Studio Code with the c/c++ extension

The libraries used are: time, Time, and iostream.
